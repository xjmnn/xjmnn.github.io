# Introduction
The [iDCU7x series DC UPS](https://www.rfnets.com/dc-ups-list) module is an intelligent DC uninterruptible power supply system designed to support user-adjustable power output, battery or supercapacitor backup systems with wide input voltage, and input voltage regulation systems that are ideal for high-impedance input sources as power input-solar panels. The DC UPS contains a synchronous buck-boost converter with high-precision voltage and current regulation, and automatically selects the system power path from the adapter or battery. External lithium battery BMS data can be collected in real time through the I2C interface, including PACK voltage and current, temperature, Soc/Soh parameters, and single-cell battery balancing voltage.
The [iDCU7x DC UPS](https://www.rfnets.com/dc-ups-list) is designed as a pluggable interface with a 5.0mm pitch, suitable for industrial automation/intelligent equipment power supply, and the module size supports mechanical hard disk installation, especially suitable for artificial intelligence scenarios that require motor starting impact current.
