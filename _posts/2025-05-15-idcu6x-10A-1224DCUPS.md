The iDCU6x series DC UPS module is an intelligent DC uninterruptible power supply system, designed to support user-adjustable power output, support a battery or supercapacitor backup system with a wide input voltage, and the input voltage regulation system is very suitable for high impedance input sources as power input-solar panels. The DC UPS contains a synchronous buck-boost converter with high-precision voltage and current regulation, and automatically selects the system power path from the adapter or battery. The iDCU6x series provides two configuration modes: built-in energy storage or external energy storage, the external energy storage configuration mode can collect the battery input voltage/current, output voltage/current, battery voltage/current in real time. The built-in energy storage configuration adds intelligent battery pack BMS functions, including PACK voltage and current, temperature, Soc/Soh parameters and single-cell cell equalization voltage.
The iDCU6x DC UPS is designed as a 5.0mm pitch pluggable interface, which is suitable for power supply for industrial automation/smart devices, and the module size supports the installation of mechanical hard disks, especially suitable for artificial intelligence scenarios where the motor starts inrush current.
