# Introduction
The [iDCU6x](https://www.rfnets.com/dc-ups-list/dcups-rdcu6x-m-buck-boost)series DC UPS module is an intelligent DC uninterruptible power supply system, designed to support user-adjustable power output, support a battery or supercapacitor backup system with a wide input voltage, and the input voltage regulation system is very suitable for high impedance input sources as power input-solar panels. 

The [DC UPS](https://www.rfnets.com/dc-ups-list) contains a synchronous buck-boost converter with high-precision voltage and current
regulation, and automatically selects the system power path from the adapter or battery. The iDCU6x series provides two configuration modes: built-in energy storage or external energy storage, the external energy storage configuration mode can collect the battery input voltage/current, output voltage/current, battery voltage/current in real time. 

The built-in energy storage configuration adds intelligent battery pack BMS functions, including PACK voltage and current, temperature, Soc/Soh parameters and single-cell cell equalization voltage.

The iDCU6x [DC UPS](https://www.rfnets.com/dc-ups-list) is designed as a 5.0mm pitch pluggable interface, which is suitable for power supply for industrial automation/smart devices, and the module size supports the installation of mechanical hard disks, especially suitable for artificial intelligence scenarios where the motor starts inrush current.
